## Description 
This Self Learning's web profile was created using Laravel and Bootstrap framework. The reason for using Laravel was to enable the use of routes for easy page-to-page navigation within the website. Bootstrap, on the other hand, was used to simplify the CSS styling of the web profile by calling the pre-existing classes. The Bootstrap framework used in the project was installed locally and can be found inside the Laravel project folder, Bootstrap has been installed. The web profile that I created consists of one page that includes sections such as Home, About Me, Education, Skills, and Contact Me.

## The Documentation For The Web Profile

### Bootstrap implementation on Laravel
The documentation for my code is presented below. It covers the installation of Bootstrap via the npm library, as well as the implementation of Laravel routes in web.php to enable redirection to other web pages, similar to what is described in the website documentation below.

### Home
The home section displays the initial view of the website page. When selecting one of the menus on the navigation bar, such as clicking on the About Me menu, it will redirect you to the About Me section on the same website page.
